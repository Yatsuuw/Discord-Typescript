# Installation

Download the Github directory, unzip the folder, configure the ".example.env" file, then rename it to ".env". Open a command prompt, then perform the following commands:

- ```cd C:/users/{user}/desktop/"Discord-Bot"``` : Go to the bot folder.
- ```npm run deploy-prod``` : Deploy the bot's commands in the Discord API.
- ```npm run build``` : Transform the bot's TypeScript files into JavaScript files.
- ```npm run start``` : Start the bot with the JavaScript files.

The ```npm run dev``` command starts the bot with the TypeScript files. For online bot maintenance and hosting, this is not recommended. It is better to use the JavaScript files.

The ```npm run deploy``` command saves the bot's commands locally on the server specified in the ".env" file. This avoids going through the API and waiting for them to be recorded. Recommended during the bot development phase only.
